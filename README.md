# Face_Generations_GAN_Project

Face Generation
In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images 
of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. 
At the end of the notebook, I would be able to visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how it performs; 
my generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

Get the Data
I used the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) to train my adversarial networks.

This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) I had worked with, and so, I defined
deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. I utilized a GPU for training.
